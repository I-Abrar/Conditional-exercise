Java Exercises

Here I have 2 java files containing different exercises. 

**FlowChart.java**
Q: Create a method which accepts *3 parameters*, *2 integers* and *a boolean*.
If the *boolean* is **true**, the method will *return* a sum of the two numbers, and it if is **false** it will *return* the multiplication of the two numbers.
For example:
If the boolean is true, the method will return a sum of the two numbers, and it if is false it will return the multiplication of the two numbers.
For example:
a) Input (1, 2, true) -> 3
b) Input (3, 3, false) -> 9
c) Input (1, 1, true) -> 2

Using FlowChart.java file you can insert those numbers and a boolean into the main method you can get the expected result.


**FlowChartLogic.java**
In this class I have used nested if and else statement to do the exercise. If you look at *Image1.png* file which illustrates the flow chart diagram of how the 
java program should operate. It will give you the result. Also, to input the number you need to do it from main. You can improve it by using the scanner class which
makes the user from terminal.

*For example,
 Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
 Make sure to import **java.util.Scanner;**
 Depending on your input you can choose the syntax.
 i.e for my case
 int i = sc.NextInt();*
 
 This will enable to use user interface in terminal.
